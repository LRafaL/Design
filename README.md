# Test Design Techniques

This section is dedicated to designing test cases for the web application [demoshopping.ru]( https://demoshopping.ru/) using test design techniques.
demoshopping.ru is a web application that allows users to register, log in, browse the catalog, add items to the cart, place orders, and make payments.
For testing the web application, test design techniques were applied to the Registration, Catalog, and Payment modules:
